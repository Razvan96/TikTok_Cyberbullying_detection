# TikTok_Cyberbullying_detection
A deep learning-based solution for cyberbullying detection in TikTok videos

Our program is based on the code from the following GitHub file: https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/examples/vision/video_transformers.py. The main contributions that we came with are:
  *We implemented at the beginning of our code a mechanism that randomly picks all the videos from the dataset and divides them into two separate directories with 80% for training and 20% for testing.
  *We increased the maximum number of frames that are taken from a video for processing and feature extraction from 20 to 30.
  *We increased the number of pixels from the side of the square that is cropped from an image from 128 to 500.
  *We have increased the number of epochs from 5 to 20.
